Also, the hidden_dim and n_layers tend to affect the converge time so they were chosen in order to keep a reasonable training time. The learning rate I set it to 0.002 as trying a higher value, e.g. 0.005 the validation loss performance was poorer and had high variations and even increases, probably due to not able to determine correctly the local minima. Lower values for learning rate, e.g. 0.001 hurt the training time."
